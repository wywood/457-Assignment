The equations in class for angle and distance did not give us the correct answer so we had to modify them (adding or subtracting 90 from the angle, different distance equation for line 2). 
We weren't sure if our dataset was wrong from the previous parts, or if we were implementing the equations incorrectly, so we submitted with incorrect numbers for line 2 distances.
